# Chess
By Cory S

A complete chess game, for The Odin Project's Ruby course (final project).
Includes all legal moves, including: Castling (only if king and rook haven't made their first move this game), en passant (only playable on 5th rank, opponent pawn on adjacent tile and moved 2 tiles last turn).

Game looks for check and checkmate each turn.

Serialization allows for saving and loading.
